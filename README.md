# FocusList app

A small, keyboard-friendly Todo app built with vanilla JavaScript and ES modules. Create tasks with dates, mark them complete, and remove them—backed by a clean architecture using two small, focused classes: Todo for UI items and FormValidator for client-side validation.

## How it works

-Create todos (title + optional date)
-Mark complete or unmark
-Delete
-Live client-side validation (errors + disabled submit)
-Keyboard-friendly focus states
-ES Modules with single-responsibility classes

## Technology

-HTML5, CSS3
-Vanilla JavaScript (ES Modules)
-Form validation using HTML5 constraints + custom UI states
-UUID for unique ids if you add persistence/advanced features
